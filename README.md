# GSP-and-PrefixSpan-Comparison
Implementation of GSP and PrefixSpan algorithms for Sequential Pattern Mining.

## Input
    * Both algo takes a datapath and configpath.
    * Datapath is the path of the datafile in CSV format.
    * Datafile entries are sequences with session elements containing transaction item seperated by commas.
    * Configpath conatins the parameter value minSupport.
    * A SeqDBCreator is also provided for generating datafiles of required length.


## Output
  * Output of each algo shows freaquent sequences of various length having specified minimum support.
  * Also running time of each algo is calculated for comparison purposes.
